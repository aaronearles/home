Yes, there are several Web Application Firewall (WAF) and OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) modules that you can use with Nginx to enhance security. Here are a few popular ones:

**1. ModSecurity**

ModSecurity is a popular open-source WAF that can be used with Nginx. It provides a robust set of security features, including:

* Request and response filtering
* Intrusion detection and prevention
* Protection against common web attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
* Support for OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)

To use ModSecurity with Nginx, you'll need to:

* Install the `modsecurity` module: `apt-get install libmodsecurity-dev`
* Configure ModSecurity in your Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf` or `default.conf`)
* Load the OWASP ModSecurity CRS rules

Example configuration:
```nginx
http {
    ...
    modsecurity on;
    modsecurity_rule_file /path/to/modsecurity.conf;
    modsecurity_rules_file /path/to/owasp-crs-3.0/master/rules/*.conf;

    server {
        listen 8080;

        location / {
            # ... your proxy configuration here ...
        }
    }
}
```
**2. Nginx OWASP ModSecurity Web Application Firewall**

This module is a native Nginx module that provides a WAF based on the OWASP ModSecurity CRS. It's a simpler alternative to ModSecurity and provides a more streamlined configuration process.

To use this module, you'll need to:

* Install the `nginx-module-owasp-modsecurity` package: `apt-get install nginx-module-owasp-modsecurity`
* Configure the module in your Nginx configuration file (`nginx.conf` or `default.conf`)

Example configuration:
```nginx
http {
    ...
    owasp_modsecurity on;
    owasp_modsecurity_rules_file /path/to/owasp-crs-3.0/master/rules/*.conf;

    server {
        listen 8080;

        location / {
            # ... your proxy configuration here ...
        }
    }
}
```
**3. Fail2Ban**

Fail2Ban is not a traditional WAF, but it's a useful tool for blocking IP addresses that have repeatedly failed authentication or have been detected as malicious.

To use Fail2Ban with Nginx, you'll need to:

* Install Fail2Ban: `apt-get install fail2ban`
* Configure Fail2Ban to monitor Nginx logs and block IP addresses that trigger the rules

Example configuration:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf
```
Add the following lines:
```bash
[nginx]
enabled  = true
filter   = nginx-http-auth
action   = iptables[name=nginx, port=80, protocol=tcp]
logpath  = /var/log/nginx/error.log
maxretry = 3
```
**4. Nginx Lua Module**

The Nginx Lua module provides a scripting interface for Nginx, allowing you to write custom security rules and filters using Lua.

To use this module, you'll need to:

* Install the `nginx-lua` package: `apt-get install nginx-lua`
* Write custom Lua scripts to implement your security rules

Example configuration:
```nginx
http {
    ...
    lua_shared_dict lua_cache 10m;
    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua/files/?.lua";

    server {
        listen 8080;

        location / {
            lua_access_handler /path/to/lua/access.lua;
            # ... your proxy configuration here ...
        }
    }
}
```
These are just a few examples of WAF and OWASP modules that you can use with Nginx. Be sure to research each option and choose the one that best fits your specific use case.
